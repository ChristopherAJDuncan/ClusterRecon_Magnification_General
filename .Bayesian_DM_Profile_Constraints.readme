Readme for the Bayesian Posterior method of DM profile model fitting


#####Limitation of Method#######

23Jun2014: With the strong lensing routines, this has been shonw to be unbiased iff a core radius is used. For example a core cut of 1' is unbiased to around r200 = 1.8. Without the core cut, individual posteriors are noisy and combined posteriors have sharp cut off. This could occur for two reasons:
1. High magnification where the lensed prior is moved out of the survey limits. In this case the renormalisation of the likelihood would be zero.
2. High and negative magnification for galaxies which lie close to the Einstein Radius. These could also possibly affect prior, howver the tests were don on a pre-constructed prior.

In both these cases, the posterior is manually set to zero. Case 1 is a limiation of the data - we do not know the size-magnitude distribution outside the survey limits.
